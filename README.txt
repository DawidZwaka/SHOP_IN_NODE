# SHOP_IN_NODE

**shop_in_node** is an application used for shop management. it comes to you with two interfaces:

 - Store page - allows users to buy some stuff from your store,
 - Administration panel - allows you to manage the store
 
## Description

Whole project is based on technologies such as **Node.js** ( Express.js ), **MongoDB** (mongoose),
**Javascript**. It is the backbone of entire application, but I also use other libraries that help me develop this app, including: 

 - **pug** - as a template engine,
 - **SCSS**, **Bootstrap** - for website styling,
 - **JQuery slim** - in frontend scripts,
 - And many others...

On the backend project is build according to the [MVC](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller) model.
